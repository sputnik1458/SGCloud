# SGCloud
An automated cloud storage system using SSH and git

## Usage
After cloning the repository, run the `sgcloud.sh` script. That's it! Your local device will now "push" and "pull" modifications to and from the remote server every 30 seconds. For increased security, disable Password Authentication for SSH. To start syncing at boot, add `sgcloud.sh` to your list of autostart programs.
