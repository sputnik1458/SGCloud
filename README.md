# SGCloud
An automated cloud storage system using SSH and git

## Usage
After cloning the repository, run the `sgcloud.sh` script. Your local device will now "push" and "pull" modifications to and from the remote server every 30 seconds. For increased security, disable Password Authentication for SSH.
