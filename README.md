# SGCloud
An automated cloud storage system using SSH and git

## Usage
After cloning the repository, run the `sgcloud.sh`. Your local device will now "push" and "pull" modifications to and from the remote server according to the set interval. For increased security, disable Password Authentication for SSH.
